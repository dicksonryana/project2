Our Objective:

    It is an interesting time to be alive at the least. Some would say we are learning a lot of horrible truths about how the world works in a time of 
    
    crisis. However you may feel about the times, one thing is certain: there is a wealth of data out there that needs to be analyzed. Our plan is to use 
    
    google trends to view different trends over the last [as of yet undecided amount of] months, before and after the start of the covid-19 [pandemic? 
    
    scare? lockdowns?]. The categories we have chosen are [tentatively: Guns, Streaming Services, Toiletries, Groceries, Pet adoption]. We will then 
    
    search 3 subcartegories and compare them with their category, i.e. ak-47, [gun 2], [gun 3] with guns. 

    
    
    After viewing possible trends we will use google's API to build a data base which we will then use our data base to make our own API in flask. 
    
    Finally we will use our API to visualize our data in a [dashboard format or interactive graph]
